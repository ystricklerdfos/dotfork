        <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #666; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 1.6;">
            We review funding rounds like album releases. The investors are the features, the valuation is the production value, and the terms are the tracklist. Some rounds are classic debuts. Others are disappointing sophomore efforts. A few are career-defining masterpieces.

                Adobe tried to buy Figma for $20B. Regulators said no. Figma walked away with $1B termination fee. Now worth more than the original offer. A triumph of regulatory intervention.
