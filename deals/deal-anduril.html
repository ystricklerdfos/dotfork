            <strong>DEAL SPECS:</strong> Series F • $1.5B raised • $14B valuation • Lead: Founders Fund
        </div>

        <div class="review-body">
            <p>
            Anduril's $1.5B Series F isn't just another bloated late-stage round—it's the sound of Silicon Valley finally admitting that maybe, just maybe, the military-industrial complex had the right idea all along. At a $14B valuation, Palmer Luckey's defense darling has officially entered rarified air, the kind of numbers that would make even a16z's crypto bag nervous. This is venture capital's full-throated embrace of what I've been saying for years: when push comes to shove, the only sustainable moat is literal firepower. Founders Fund leading makes perfect sense—Thiel's been preaching the gospel of atoms over bits since before it was cool, and this deal feels like his vindication tour. The timing, coming as Ukraine grinds through its third year and Taiwan tensions simmer, suggests LPs are finally waking up to geopolitical reality.

            <p>
            The deal structure itself reads like a greatest hits compilation of late-stage excess, but with better fundamentals than your typical unicorn's sophomore slump. That $14B valuation looks aggressive until you remember Palantir's journey from misunderstood data darling to $20B+ public company. The Series F designation tells its own story—this isn't some scrappy startup anymore, it's a machine that's been methodically executing the same playbook since 2017. Unlike the AI bubble's paper valuations, Anduril's numbers are backed by actual Pentagon contracts, the kind of revenue visibility that makes CFOs weep with joy. The risk here isn't product-market fit (defense procurement moves slowly but pays reliably), it's political exposure. One administration change, one Congressional hearing about "techno-solutionism," and suddenly your growth story becomes a regulatory nightmare.
            </p>

            <p>
            What's fascinating is how this round positions Anduril within the broader defense tech renaissance. Where companies like Shield AI and Skydio are still finding their sound, Anduril has evolved into something approaching a complete ecosystem—autonomous systems, AI integration, manufacturing scale. It's ambitious in scope, occasionally flawed in execution (ask anyone who's dealt with their early border wall prototypes), but undeniably the genre's most compelling narrative. The $1.5B war chest suggests they're not just building products anymore; they're building infrastructure, the kind of vertically integrated beast that can compete with Raytheon's established catalog. That's either visionary or hubristic, depending on whether you believe Silicon Valley's "move fast and break things" ethos translates to literal life-and-death hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
            The broader venture scene should pay attention to what this deal represents: a massive bet that technical superiority still matters in an increasingly multipolar world. While crypto funds chase memecoins and AI startups burn through runway on GPU clusters, defense tech is quietly attracting the kind of patient, strategic capital that built the Valley's original giants. Sure, the moral calculus gets complicated when your product's success metrics include "enemies neutralized," but that's always been the uncomfortable truth about innovation—it's often driven by conflict. This round doesn't just validate Anduril; it signals that we're entering an era where the most important technological advances might not come from consumer apps or social networks, but from companies building tools for an increasingly dangerous world.

            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> A bold, occasionally unsettling opus that confirms defense tech's evolution from niche curiosity to essential infrastructure—even if the lyrics make some listeners uncomfortable.
