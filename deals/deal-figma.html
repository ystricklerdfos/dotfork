            <strong>DEAL SPECS:</strong> Acquisition (Failed) • $20B raised • $20B (attempted) valuation • Lead: Adobe
        </div>

        <div class="review-body">
            <p>
            The Figma-Adobe deal wasn't just a failed acquisition – it was a masterclass in strategic positioning disguised as regulatory defeat. Like a band that gets dropped by a major label only to find they're better off independent, Figma's $20B near-miss represents the rare venture deal that succeeded precisely because it failed. This is aggregation theory in reverse: instead of Adobe consuming the upstart to maintain platform dominance, the would-be acquirer got played for $1B in breakup fees while Figma retained its independence and design tool supremacy. The regulatory intervention wasn't market interference; it was market correction, preventing Adobe from strangling innovation in the collaborative design space where Figma had already won.
            </p>

            <p>
            What makes this deal fascinating isn't the headline valuation – we've seen plenty of inflated startup prices – but the timing and terms that reveal Adobe's desperation. By 2022, Figma had achieved something rare in enterprise software: genuine network effects that made switching costs irrelevant because collaboration itself was the moat. Adobe's Creative Suite fortress was crumbling as design teams migrated to browser-based workflows, and the $20B offer reads less like strategic acquisition and more like panic buying. The all-cash structure screamed urgency, while the $1B termination fee revealed Adobe knew regulatory scrutiny was likely. This wasn't confident platform expansion; this was legacy software's last gasp.
            </p>

            <p>
            The regulatory rejection transformed what should have been Figma's exit into their empire moment. Walking away with $1B essentially gave them the world's most expensive war chest while maintaining independence in a market they increasingly dominate. Compare this to other recent "failed" mega-deals like Nvidia-Arm, where regulatory interference killed genuine innovation synergies – here, blocking the acquisition preserved competitive dynamics in design tools. Figma's post-rejection valuation surge past $20B proves the market agreed: they're worth more as Adobe's existential threat than as their subsidiary. The termination fee funded their next growth phase while keeping their collaborative moat intact.
            </p>

            <p>
            This deal represents a broader shift in how we evaluate venture outcomes. Traditional metrics would score this as a failed exit, but Figma extracted maximum value from Adobe's desperation while maintaining strategic independence. They've essentially achieved the venture capital holy grail: taking money from a competitor who wanted to eliminate them, then using those funds to accelerate that competitor's demise. The regulatory environment that killed the deal wasn't anti-business – it was pro-competition, ensuring that platform consolidation doesn't eliminate the very innovation that makes these markets valuable. Figma didn't just survive their encounter with Adobe; they emerged stronger, wealthier, and more dangerous.
            </p>

            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> A rare sophomore effort that's better because the major label deal fell through – now they own their masters and the whole damn studio.
