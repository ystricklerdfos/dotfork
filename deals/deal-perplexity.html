            <strong>DEAL SPECS:</strong> Series B • $73.6M raised • $520M valuation • Lead: IVP, NEA
        </div>

        <div class="review-body">
            <p>
            Perplexity's $73.6M Series B is the kind of sophomore effort that makes you wonder if the debut was just beginner's luck. Sure, Aravind Srinivas has the DeepMind pedigree—like being in a critically acclaimed band before going solo—but this round feels more like venture capital karaoke than a genuine disruption anthem. The $520M valuation hits that sweet spot of "not completely insane but definitely optimistic," which in today's AI funding scene is practically conservative. IVP and NEA leading the charge makes sense; they're the equivalent of major labels who know how to package talent, even when the underlying material needs work. The timing couldn't be better with everyone desperately seeking Google alternatives, but the execution? That's where this deal starts hitting some sour notes.
            </p>

            <p>
            The terms sheet reads like a band trying to recreate their breakout hit without understanding what made it special in the first place. Taking on Google isn't new—we've seen this movie with Cuil, Blekko, and countless others who thought they could out-search the search giant. What's different here is the AI wrapper, which is like adding Auto-Tune to folk music: technically impressive but missing the point. The scraping controversies are the equivalent of sampling disputes—inevitable when you're building on others' content but potentially deal-breaking if the lawyers get involved. Srinivas has the technical chops, but turning research brilliance into sustainable business advantage requires a different kind of genius, one that $73.6M can't simply purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
            The investor lineup tells a more interesting story than the company narrative. IVP and NEA aren't known for throwing money at moonshots; they're methodical, which suggests they see something beyond the AI hype cycle. But their involvement also signals this is very much an establishment play—venture capital's version of a major label signing rather than an indie breakthrough. The round size itself feels calibrated: big enough to make headlines, small enough to avoid the scrutiny that comes with nine-figure raises. In a market where AI deals are either massive or microscopic, Perplexity found the middle ground. Whether that's strategic positioning or lack of conviction from investors remains the key question.
            </p>

            <p>
            Looking at the broader AI funding landscape, this deal feels like competent craftsmanship rather than inspired artistry. While companies like Anthropic and OpenAI command billion-dollar valuations with infrastructure plays, Perplexity is essentially building a better interface for existing technology—more cover band than original composition. The "cite sources sometimes" approach to attribution reveals the fundamental tension in AI search: you need to be fast and comprehensive, but also legally and ethically defensible. That's not a technical problem you solve with venture funding; it's a philosophical challenge that could derail the entire premise. The deal works as a hedge bet for investors, but feels more like following trends than setting them.

            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> A technically proficient but ultimately derivative effort that plays all the right notes without creating a memorable melody.
