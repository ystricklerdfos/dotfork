            <p>The moment felicis.com loads, you're greeted with a brutally minimalist hero section that screams "we hired the cheapest Webflow developer we could find." The telltale `.w-richtext` classes and cookie-cutter div soup structure immediately reveal their $3 billion fund couldn't spring for custom development. Their main navigation consists of exactly four links - Portfolio, Team, News, and Contact - which feels like the digital equivalent of a demo tape with only three songs because the band ran out of ideas. The typography hierarchy is more confused than my relationship with inherited wealth; H1 tags are smaller than some paragraph text, and the letter-spacing on their tagline "Partnering with founders building the future" is so aggressive it looks like it's having an anxiety attack.</p>

            <p>Diving into the technical wasteland, their Lighthouse performance score probably hovers around 45/100, dragged down by an embarrassing 847KB of JavaScript for what amounts to a glorified brochure site. The hero image weighs in at a bloated 2.3MB - apparently nobody told them about image optimization, which is ironic given they've probably lectured portfolio companies about technical debt. Their CSS is a masterclass in inefficiency, with 73 unused selectors and enough `!important` declarations to make any frontend developer weep. The mobile experience feels like an afterthought designed by someone who's never actually used a phone, with tap targets smaller than my confidence at networking events and a hamburger menu that occasionally decides not to close.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most damning is their complete abandonment of basic SEO principles - their meta descriptions are either missing or generic WordPress defaults, and their OpenGraph images are just their logo stretched to 1200x630 like digital taffy. The irony cuts deep: here's a firm that's invested in countless startups, presumably offering guidance on growth and user acquisition, yet their own canonical web presence has the SEO footprint of a Bandcamp page from 2003. Their portfolio section loads via a janky AJAX call that breaks the back button and probably tanks their search rankings faster than a crypto startup in a bear market. It's the venture capital equivalent of Radiohead releasing OK Computer as a cassette-only release recorded on a Nokia phone.</p>

            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> A $3 billion fund serving up a $300 Webflow template - the technical equivalent of showing up to Demo Day with a PowerPoint from 2007.
