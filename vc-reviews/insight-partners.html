            <p>The moment I hit insightpartners.com, my dev tools lit up like a Christmas tree at Burning Man – 127 network requests just to load their homepage. This $90 billion fund apparently decided that shipping 2.8MB of unoptimized JavaScript was the move, because nothing says "we understand technology" like a Time to First Byte that makes dial-up look speedy. Their React hydration is messier than my tent after that sandstorm in Black Rock City, with enough unused CSS to choke a webpack bundle analyzer. The irony is thicker than playa dust: they're funding the next generation of lean startups while serving a homepage that would make a 2003 Flash site blush.</p>

            <p>Diving into the source code reveals a Frankenstein's monster of development decisions. They're running a headless CMS setup that's half Contentful, half custom React components, and entirely over-engineered. The CSS class naming convention appears to have been designed by committee – we've got `.hero-section-wrapper-container-div` sitting next to `.btn-primary-v2-final-FINAL`. Their component tree is deeper than my existential crisis after pitching that blockchain-for-dogs startup to a partner at 3 AM. Performance-wise, their Largest Contentful Paint clocks in around 4.2 seconds, which in VC time means they've already moved on to the next pitch deck.</p>

            <p>The tracking situation is where things get properly dystopian. I counted 23 third-party scripts including HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Analytics, Hotjar, and something called "InsightIQ" that's probably their own analytics frankenstein. Their Content Security Policy is more porous than a festival porta-potty, allowing inline scripts from domains I've never heard of. The privacy policy mentions "necessary cookies" while loading enough trackers to make the NSA jealous. For a firm that probably lectures portfolio companies about GDPR compliance, they're treating visitor data like it's community property at a drum circle.</p>

            <p>The mobile experience deserves its own technical post-mortem. Their hero video – a whopping 47MB of "innovation footage" – tries to autoplay on mobile Safari and immediately crashes the tab. The hamburger menu has a z-index issue that would make any front-end developer weep, and their contact form throws a CORS error that's been sitting unfixed since their last site deploy 8 months ago. The responsive breakpoints are clearly the work of someone who's never actually used a phone, with text that either disappears entirely or overlaps like my memories of that time I tried to explain DeFi to a Series A partner while rolling.</p>

            <p>Look, I get it – VCs aren't supposed to be web development savants. But when you're managing $90 billion and your website performs worse than a Y Combinator demo day project, there's a problem. The foundation is solid enough (decent information architecture, actual content strategy), but the execution screams "we hired the cheapest dev shop we could find and never looked back." It's functional, it's got all the required VC website ingredients, but it's also a masterclass in how not to practice what you preach to your portfolio companies about technical excellence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verdict-box">
            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> Like a promising Series A startup with solid fundamentals but terrible execution – they've got the content and strategy right, but shipped a bloated, over-tracked mess that would make their own portfolio CTOs file a bug report.
