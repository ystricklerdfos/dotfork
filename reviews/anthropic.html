            Look, I've been staring at this Anthropic website for twenty minutes now and I keep getting this weird feeling like I'm reading a startup's therapy session notes. "We build AI to serve humanity's long-term well-being" – Jesus Christ, when did tech companies start talking like guidance counselors? There's something deeply unsettling about a company that builds artificial minds while simultaneously patting itself on the back for being so goddamn responsible about it. It's like watching someone perform surgery while constantly reminding you they washed their hands first. The whole "public benefit corporation" thing feels like putting a COEXIST bumper sticker on a nuclear submarine.
            </p>

            <p>
            The design is peak Silicon Valley beige – all that white space and sans-serif typography that screams "we're serious people doing serious work." They've got this Claude thing, which apparently is "the best model in the world for coding, agents, computer use, and enterprise workflows," and I'm sitting here wondering when we started talking about AI like it's a Swiss Army knife. The copy reads like it was written by a committee of philosophers who've never actually used the internet. "When you're talking to a large language model, what exactly is it that you're talking to?" I don't know, man, maybe the same thing I'm talking to when I yell at my refrigerator – nothing that gives a shit about my problems.
            </p>

            <p>
            What kills me is this whole "intentional pauses to consider the effects" rhetoric while they're simultaneously promoting their latest and greatest model. It's like a drug dealer who won't stop lecturing you about addiction while counting your money. They want credit for being thoughtful while moving fast and breaking things just like everyone else. The website has this weird tension where they're trying to be both the cool tech company with the hot new AI and the responsible adults in the room who understand the grave implications of their work. Pick a lane, guys.
            </p>

            <p>
            The user experience feels like being trapped in a TED talk – everything is positioned as profound insight when it's mostly just corporate speak dressed up in humanitarian clothing. They mention "bold steps forward and intentional pauses" like they invented the concept of thinking before you act. The whole thing reeks of that particular brand of tech company narcissism where they think they're saving the world by building better chatbots. And don't get me started on that cookie notice at the bottom – even their privacy disclaimer sounds like it was written by someone who's really proud of themselves for asking permission first.
            </p>

            <p>
            Here's the thing though: beneath all the sanctimonious positioning and design-by-committee aesthetics, there might actually be something here. The fact that they're at least pretending to care about AI safety puts them ahead of companies that don't even bother with the pretense. But this website makes them feel like the kind of people who would explain the philosophical implications of your coffee order while you're just trying to get some caffeine. They're probably doing important work, but they've wrapped it in so much self-congratulatory rhetoric that it's hard to take seriously. It's competent, it's well-intentioned, but it's also deeply, profoundly boring in that specifically Silicon Valley way.
