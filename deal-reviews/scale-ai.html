            <p>Tiger Global was to 2021 what Limp Bizkit was to TRL—everywhere, inexplicable, and funding things that made you question whether the adults were actually in charge. This $7.3B valuation for Scale AI represents the exact moment when "we label your training data" became worth more than Boeing's market cap during a bad week, which is either proof of concept or proof that we've collectively lost the plot. The company essentially runs sophisticated sweatshops where contractors categorize images for machine learning models, except instead of making sneakers they're teaching robots to recognize stop signs. Revolutionary? Sure, if you consider the industrial revolution a fun time for workers. At 22x their rumored ARR, this pricing made sense only in a universe where money was free, rates were zero, and Tiger Global was processing deals faster than Scale's workers were labeling bounding boxes. The infrastructure play thesis holds water until you remember that every tech giant can and will build this in-house the moment margins matter again.</p>

            <p>The timing here screams "peak froth" louder than a cappuccino machine at a LinkedIn influencer meetup. May 2021 was when SPACs were still marginally respectable, Cathie Wood was a prophet, and VCs were competing on wire speed rather than due diligence. Dragoneer and Tiger weren't just co-leading deals—they were speedrunning capitalism, turning term sheets around in hours like they were flipping sneakers on StockX. The AI narrative was already overheated, but nobody cared because OpenAI was still mostly theoretical and everyone assumed they'd need Scale's army of annotators forever. Spoiler: they didn't. The market rewarded scale over unit economics, growth over profitability, and narrative over numbers. In retrospect, this deal represented the exact inflection point where "picks and shovels" became picks and shovels that cost more than gold.</p>

            <p>Scale's fundamental business model—humans doing repetitive cognitive labor so AI can eventually eliminate those same humans—contains a delicious irony that would make Kafka horny. The company's competitive moat supposedly comes from data quality and operational excellence in managing global workforces, which is VC-speak for "we're really good at coordinating gig workers across time zones." Their customers include every AI darling that subsequently either imploded or built competing solutions in-house, because when you're OpenAI or Anthropic, eventually you realize paying Scale's margins is stupid when you can just hire the annotators yourself. The growth trajectory looked hockey-stick beautiful until you zoomed out and saw that revenue concentration, customer stickiness, and defensibility were all question marks dressed up in enterprise sales clothing. Defense and autonomous vehicle contracts provided narrative credibility, but also tied the company's fate to sectors moving slower than continental drift.</p>

            <p>The exit math here requires either sustained delusion or actual miracles. An IPO at $7.3B means you need public market investors to believe that human-powered data labeling remains essential in an age of synthetic data and self-supervised learning—good fucking luck with that pitch in 2024. Strategic acquisition possibilities exist but they're all at massive haircuts: Google, Meta, or Microsoft could buy them, but why would they pay billions for something they've already partially replicated internally? The 2021 vintage of mega-rounds aged like milk, and Scale's sitting in the fridge next to Instacart and Stripe, waiting for someone to acknowledge the smell. Tiger and Dragoneer's portfolios from this era read like a graveyard of markdowns and flat rounds. The real red flag isn't what Scale does—it's that what they do becomes less necessary every quarter as models improve and synthetic training data gets cheaper.</p>

            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> A perfectly serviceable business model that got a 2021 valuation to match its 2025 obsolescence timeline.
