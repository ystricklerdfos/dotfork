        <div class="review-body">
            <p>Stripe just raised $6.5 billion at a $50 billion valuation and somehow convinced the world this wasn't a funeral with catering. Let me do the math for you since apparently Andreessen Horowitz's calculator app was broken: this is a 47% haircut from their 2021 peak of $95 billion. They're calling it a "Series I" like we wouldn't notice they've alphabet-souped their way past the point where most companies either IPO or admit defeat. The Collison brothers are out here acting like payment processing is some undiscovered country while they're basically very expensive middleware getting commoditized by every neobank with a Stripe competitor tab open. Goldman Sachs co-leading this round is the financial equivalent of your dad chaperoning prom—nobody's psyched about it, but someone's gotta make sure the lights stay on.</p>

            <p>The timing here is catastrophically funny. March 2023: SVB just imploded two weeks prior, the Fed is hiking rates like they're training for a marathon, and every growth-stage fintech is basically discovering what "unit economics" means for the first time. Into this apocalypse scenario, Stripe decides to raise at 10x revenue (optimistically) when profitable payment processors trade at 3-4x. Buy-now-pay-later is collapsing, crypto winters have arrived, and e-commerce growth rates have returned to "please god just break even" territory. But sure, let's pretend Atlas and Stripe Capital are revolutionary products and not desperate attempts to find margin in a margin-less business. The embedded finance narrative was already stale by 2023; by now it's basically fintech kombucha that's been fermenting too long.</p>

            <p>Here's what kills me: a16z and GIC aren't stupid, which means this is either a reputation preservation round or they know something about Stripe's enterprise contracts that would make this valuation make sense (spoiler: they don't). The investor quality is actually decent on paper—these aren't tourism-stage family offices—but the signaling is bizarre. You're telling me the best time to deploy $6.5 billion into a down-round for a payments company is when interest rates are 4.75% and rising? The opportunity cost alone is astronomical. They could've bought actual profitable software companies or just sat in treasuries. This smells like a consortium of existing investors averaging down while praying Stripe can somehow grow into a valuation that made sense when money was free and everyone believed in the embedded finance fairy tale.</p>

            <p>The exit potential here is like watching someone try to parallel park an aircraft carrier. Stripe needs to IPO at probably $80-100 billion to make these late-stage investors whole, which means they need to nearly double from here. In what universe? The payments TAM is massive but brutally competitive—Adyen, PayPal, Square, and now every bank with an API is eating their lunch. Their vaunted infrastructure play is real but not differentiated enough to command premium multiples in 2024-2025. Meanwhile, they're burning through capital expanding into lending and crypto infrastructure while their core business faces compression from every angle. The only thing more delusional than this valuation is thinking there's a window where public market investors will pay MORE for this story.</p>
