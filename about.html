        <h1>About DOTFORK</h1>

        <p>
        Founded in 1999 at the height of the first dot-com boom, DOTFORK has established itself as the internet's most trusted—and most feared—source of website criticism. While others obsess over functionality and user metrics, we ask the questions that matter: Does your pricing page spark joy or existential dread? Is your gradient derivative or definitive? Can a website be too fast?
        </p>

        <p>
        We believe that websites, like music, deserve serious critical analysis. A SaaS landing page is not just a conversion funnel—it's a cultural statement. A design system is not just a component library—it's a manifesto. We bring the same rigor to reviewing dot-coms that others reserve for albums, books, and films.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Rating System</h3>

        <p>
        DOTFORK reviews are rated on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0. Scores are assigned with decimal precision to reflect the nuanced reality of website excellence. A 7.8 is meaningfully different from a 7.9, even if we can't always articulate why.
        </p>

        <p>
        Sites scoring 8.5 or above receive our <strong>Best New Website</strong> designation, the industry's most coveted honor and/or most pretentious badge.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Rating Guide:</strong><br>
        9.0-10.0: Essential<br>
        8.0-8.9: Excellent<br>
        7.0-7.9: Good<br>
        6.0-6.9: Fair<br>
        5.0-5.9: Mediocre<br>
        0.0-4.9: Poor
        </p>

            Started DOTFORK in his parents' basement with a 56k modem and an unshakable conviction that GeoCities pages deserved thoughtful criticism. Pathologically precise about decimal point ratings. Has spent forty minutes debating whether something deserves an 8.3 or an 8.4. The ratings are arbitrary but that doesn't make them wrong.

            Former philosophy major who found her calling reviewing payment processors. Writes 2,000-word essays about gradient choices that reference Heidegger. Once gave a website a 6.8 because the button hover states "lacked intentionality." Unironically uses the word "problematic" to describe CSS. Has strong feelings about Stripe.
